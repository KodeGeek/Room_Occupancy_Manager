## üöÄ Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Click on "Automation" tab
3. Click the three dots menu in the top right
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add the repository URL: `https://github.com/KodeGeek/Room_Occupancy_Manager`
6. Select category: "AppDaemon"
7. Click "Add"
8. Click "Install" on the Room Occupancy Manager card
9. Restart AppDaemon addon

### Manual Installation

1. Copy `rooms_occupancy_manager.py` to your AppDaemon apps directory:
   ```
   /config/appdaemon/apps/room_occupancy_manager/rooms_occupancy_manager.py
   ```

2. Add configuration to your `apps.yaml` (see Configuration section)

3. Restart AppDaemon addon

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Step 1: Create Required Home Assistant Entities

#### Derivative Sensors for Rate-of-Change Detection (configuration.yaml)

The app can optionally use Home Assistant's derivative sensors for enhanced rate-of-change detection:

```yaml
sensor:
  # Temperature rate sensor - detects rapid temperature changes
  - platform: derivative
    source: sensor.kids_bathroom_temperature
    name: 'Kids Bathroom Temperature Rate'
    unit_time: min
    time_window: '00:05:00'  # 5-minute statistical window

  # Humidity rate sensor - detects rapid humidity changes
  - platform: derivative
    source: sensor.kids_bathroom_humidity
    name: 'Kids Bathroom Humidity Rate'
    unit_time: min
    time_window: '00:03:00'  # 3-minute window for faster response
```

**Note**: Derivative sensors are optional but recommended for environments with significant HVAC cycling or temperature fluctuations. The app will calculate rate-of-change internally if these sensors are not configured.

#### Timer Entities (configuration.yaml)
```yaml
timer:
  kids_bathroom_occupancy:
    duration: "00:05:00"
    name: "Kids Bathroom Occupancy Timer"

  garage_occupancy:
    duration: "00:02:00"
    name: "Garage Occupancy Timer"
```

#### Optional: Light Override (configuration.yaml)
```yaml
input_boolean:
  bathroom_light_override:
    name: "Bathroom Light Override"
    icon: mdi:light-switch
```

### Step 2: Configure AppDaemon App (apps.yaml)

## üéØ Room Behaviors

### Bathroom Mode (`behavior: bathroom`)

**Designed for privacy and user control:**

- ‚úÖ **Lights**: Only turn OFF automatically when room is empty
- ‚ùå **Lights**: NEVER turn ON automatically (user controls when to turn on lights)
- ‚úÖ **Fan**: Automatically turns ON when humidity OR temperature spikes AND room is occupied
- ‚úÖ **Fan**: Automatically turns OFF when environmental conditions normalize
- ‚úÖ **Manual Fan**: Respects manual fan activation, turns off when room becomes empty

**Why Bathroom Mode?**
Bathrooms require privacy. This mode ensures the automation only helps by turning things OFF, never surprising users by turning lights ON when they enter.

### Normal Mode (`behavior: normal`)

**Full automatic control:**

- ‚úÖ Lights turn ON automatically when occupancy detected
- ‚úÖ Lights turn OFF automatically when room is empty
- ‚úÖ Standard room automation

### Night-Only Mode (`behavior: night_only`)

**Time-restricted automation:**

- ‚úÖ Lights turn ON only during configured night hours
- ‚úÖ Lights turn OFF when room is empty
- ‚úÖ Perfect for garages, hallways, utility rooms

## üî¨ How It Works

### Environmental Fan Control Algorithm

The app uses a sophisticated algorithm to detect shower activity while avoiding false triggers:

#### 1. **Occupancy Gate** ‚≠ê NEW
```
Fan Activation = (Environmental Trigger) AND (Room Occupied)
```

This prevents the fan from turning on due to:
- HVAC cycling when nobody is in the bathroom
- Open windows on humid days
- Temperature fluctuations from neighboring rooms

#### 2. **Dual Trigger System**
The fan activates if EITHER condition is met:

**Humidity Trigger:**
- Current humidity > baseline + threshold (default 10%)
- Example: Baseline 50% ‚Üí Triggers at 60%

**Temperature Trigger (Two Methods):**
- **Spike Detection**: Current temp > baseline + threshold (default 6¬∞F)
- **Rate-of-Change**: Temperature rising faster than 1¬∞F per minute

#### 3. **Baseline Tracking**
The app maintains dynamic baseline values that adapt to:
- Seasonal temperature changes
- Weather-related humidity variations
- HVAC system cycling

Baselines update gradually when no spike is detected, ensuring accurate detection year-round.

#### 4. **Automatic Shutoff**
Fan turns off when:
- **Humidity**: Drops below 40% of threshold (e.g., <4% above baseline)
- **Temperature**: Drops below 50% of threshold (e.g., <3¬∞F above baseline)

This ensures the fan runs long enough to clear moisture but doesn't waste energy.

#### 5. **Manual Override Tracking**
- Detects when user manually turns fan on/off
- Manual fan activation: Fan stays on until room is empty
- Respects user control over environmental automation

### Occupancy Detection Logic

#### With Presence Sensors (Recommended)
1. Presence ON ‚Üí Room occupied (immediate)
2. Presence OFF ‚Üí Room empty (immediate response)
3. Most accurate method

#### With Motion Sensors Only
1. Motion ON ‚Üí Room occupied
2. Motion OFF ‚Üí Start timer
3. Timer expires ‚Üí Check if motion still off
4. If motion ON when timer expires ‚Üí Restart timer (prevents premature shutoff)
5. Room marked empty only when timer expires AND no motion

#### Timer Restart Prevention
**Safety Feature**: Timer will NEVER start if:
- Any motion sensor is ON
- Any presence sensor is ON
- Any door is open

This prevents lights/fans from turning off while room is actually occupied.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Fan Keeps Turning On Randomly

**Cause**: Environmental thresholds too sensitive

**Solution**: Increase thresholds in `apps.yaml`:
```yaml
humidity_threshold: 15.0    # Increased from 10.0
temperature_threshold: 8.0  # Increased from 6.0
```

Start conservative and decrease if fan doesn't activate during actual showers.

### Fan Never Turns On

**Possible Causes**:
1. Room not detected as occupied
2. Thresholds too high
3. Sensors not reporting correctly

**Solutions**:
1. Check AppDaemon logs: Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí AppDaemon ‚Üí Logs
2. Verify occupancy sensors are working
3. Lower thresholds temporarily to test
4. Ensure humidity/temperature sensors are reporting values

### Lights Turn On in Bathroom

**Cause**: Behavior not set to bathroom mode

**Solution**: Verify in `apps.yaml`:
```yaml
kids_bathroom:
  behavior: bathroom  # Must be set!
```

### Timer Keeps Restarting

**This is normal behavior!** The timer restarts if motion is detected when it expires. This prevents lights from turning off while someone is still in the room.

If this is happening too frequently:
- Consider adding presence sensors for more accurate occupancy detection
- Increase timer duration

### Fan Doesn't Turn Off

**Possible Causes**:
1. Environmental conditions haven't normalized
2. Manual fan activation

**Solutions**:
1. Check current humidity/temperature in Home Assistant
2. Wait for conditions to normalize (fan will auto-shutoff)
3. If manually activated, fan turns off when room becomes empty

### Logs Show "Permission Denied"

**Cause**: AppDaemon doesn't have access to sensors or entities

**Solution**: Verify entity IDs exist in Home Assistant Developer Tools ‚Üí States

## üìä Monitoring and Tuning

### View Logs

AppDaemon logs show detailed operation:

Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí AppDaemon ‚Üí Logs

Look for messages like:
```
üöø SHOWER DETECTED! Humidity spike in kids_bathroom: 12.3% increase - turning on fan automatically
üí® HUMIDITY NORMALIZED! Fan auto-shutoff in kids_bathroom: humidity dropped to 3.2% above baseline
```

### Tuning Thresholds

Start with default values and monitor for 1-2 weeks:

**Too Many False Triggers?**
- Increase `humidity_threshold` and `temperature_threshold`
- Try: 12-15% humidity, 7-9¬∞F temperature

**Fan Doesn't Activate During Showers?**
- Decrease thresholds
- Try: 7-8% humidity, 4-5¬∞F temperature

**Optimal Settings Depend On**:
- Bathroom size and ventilation
- Shower temperature preferences
- HVAC system behavior
- Sensor placement and accuracy

## üéì Examples

## üîê Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Use higher thresholds initially (10% humidity, 6¬∞F temperature)
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for false triggers over 1-2 weeks
3. **Use Presence Sensors**: More accurate than motion sensors alone
4. **Create Proper Timers**: Define timer entities in `configuration.yaml`
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify each room's behavior matches expectations
6. **Bathroom Mode**: Always use `behavior: bathroom` for bathrooms to maintain privacy
7. **Light Override**: Create override input_booleans for manual control when needed
